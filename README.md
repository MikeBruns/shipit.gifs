# How to Contribute

## General Rules
+ Be a good person
+ Add GIFs that can be used in the context of shipping code reviews, design reviews or just any "Looks good to me" moment
+ You can add as many as you'd like
+ Use GIFs at a reasonable size, no more than 5MB.
+ GIFs need to pass all tests and be approved in a Pull Request.
+ Keep names all lowercase, the only special character that is allowed is a dash `-`.
+ Include all fields: `_id`, `name`, `url`, `description`, `active`.
+ Don't remove or rename any previously submitted GIFs as they could be used in the wild already.
+ If a GIF is broken, mark the active state to 0 or fix the URL.
+ Add a description so it is easy to understand the content of the GIF without opening it.
+ No graphic content.
